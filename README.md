#  Backend Server

This small node.js backend is required for completing the COBI.Bike iOS coding challenge. It can be taken as-is or it can be modified when the need arises. The backend must be submitted along with the iOS coding challenge.

To make it available to the app, it must either 
* be hosted somewhere publicly or 
* the iOS app must be able to connect to it on the local network

## Setup
* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Now it is available at `http://localhost:3000`
